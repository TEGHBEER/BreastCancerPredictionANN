This app uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict breast cancer classification as **Malignant** or **Benign**. 
The prediction is based on the following 10 features, which represent specific properties of cell nuclei present in breast cancer cell images:

- **Mean Radius (mm)**: The average distance from the center to the outermost point of the cell nucleus.
- **Mean Texture (Standard Error)**: A measure of the variation in pixel intensities within the cell's nucleus.
- **Mean Perimeter (mm)**: The average length of the boundary of the nucleus.
- **Mean Area (mmÂ²)**: The average area occupied by the nucleus.
- **Mean Smoothness (scaled)**: A measure of the smoothness of the nucleus boundary, where lower values represent smoother contours.
- **Mean Compactness (scaled)**: A measure of the shape of the nucleus, specifically the compactness or how tightly the nucleus is packed.
- **Mean Concavity (scaled)**: Measures the degree to which the boundary of the nucleus is concave.
- **Mean Concave Points (scaled)**: A measure of how many concave points are found along the boundary of the nucleus.
- **Mean Symmetry (scaled)**: A measure of how symmetrical the shape of the nucleus is.
- **Mean Fractal Dimension (scaled)**: A measure of the complexity of the boundary of the nucleus.

Each of these features is derived from a set of images of cell nuclei, and by adjusting the sliders below, you can input values for these features to predict whether the condition is benign or malignant.

Please enter the raw values for each feature and click **'Predict'** to see the result.
